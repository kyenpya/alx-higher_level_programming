This repository contains several Python scripts that demonstrate various programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and more.

List of Scripts:

0-positive_or_negative.py: Assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

1-last_digit.py: Assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints the last digit along with some conditions.

2-print_alphabet.py: Prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase without a newline.

3-print_alphabt.py: Prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

4-print_hexa.py: Prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.

5-print_comb2.py: Prints numbers from 0 to 99 with two digits, separated by a comma and space.

6-print_comb3.py: Prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order.

7-islower.py: Defines a function to check if a character is lowercase.

8-uppercase.py: Defines a function to print a string in uppercase.

9-print_last_digit.py: Defines a function to print the last digit of a number.

10-add.py: Defines a function to add two integers.

11-pow.py: Defines a function to compute the power of a number.

12-fizzbuzz.py: Defines a function to print numbers from 1 to 100 with some conditions (Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz).

Each script is well-documented and provides examples of Python programming concepts.

Usage:
To run any of the scripts, simply execute them using a Python interpreter.
